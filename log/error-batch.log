CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'

Some weights of ResNetForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/resnet-18 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.1.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([102]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.1.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 512]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([102, 512]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
